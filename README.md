## Description 
  This repo/project was created with the purpose of migrating a standard MongoDB database to a apollo/graphql database. Using queries and mutations as well as typeDef and resolvers I was able to convert the server side of things to successfully use the new libraries but unfortunately we're running into some issues when it comes to translating that to the front-end. will look into it further in the future but for now all that works perfectly are the login and signup functions as well as searchBooks.
